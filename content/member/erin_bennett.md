description = "I'm a Psychology PhD student primarily in [CoCoLab](https://cocolab.stanford.edu). I'm interested in how vague language gets resolved by context, and in particular the semantics and pragmatics of causal language. I'm also interested in sentence meaning representation and discourse relations, especially causal relations."
